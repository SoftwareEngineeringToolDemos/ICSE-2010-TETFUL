**Testful** is an evolutionary testing framework for Java programs.
It is based on the idea of _search-based testing_, working both at class and method level. The former puts objects in useful states, used by the latter to exercise the uncovered parts of the class.

**Testful** is packaged into two forms
  * as command-line tools (usable for batch test generation, or simulations)
  * as an Eclipse Plugin
